# Stop Buying Ping-Pong Tables: The 10 Foundations of a Culture That Actually Heals

> **Featured Insight:** Nobody stays at a job because of free snacks. Real culture isn't about what you buy for your team—it's about how you treat the human in front of you. This article exposes why perks fail, introduces the difference between "Extraction" and "Restoration" culture, and provides the 10H Pillars blueprint for building retention that actually lasts. Culture cannot be manufactured; it can only be modeled.

Can we have an honest conversation? Just between us?

Nobody stays at a job because of the free snacks. Nobody feels "psychologically safe" because you put a foosball table in the breakroom. And yet, when retention dips or burnout spikes, what's the first thing we do? We look for a perk to plug the hole.

As HR professionals, you are the guardians of the company soul. But lately, it feels like you're just the complaint department for the company ego. You are tired of trying to "manufacture" culture with budgets you don't have for people who don't seem to care.

Good. Because culture cannot be manufactured; it can only be modeled.

> **Real culture isn't about what you buy for your team; it's about how you treat the human in front of you.**

It is built on the **10H Pillars**—traits like *Honesty*, *Humility*, and *Health*. If your leadership team isn't *Healthy*, no amount of wellness stipends will fix the toxicity.

It's time to stop buying toys and start building foundations.

## Perks vs. Pillars: Understanding the Disconnect

We have confused "Climate" with "Culture."

### Climate is the Weather

* **Climate** is the casual Friday policy
* The office decor
* The holiday party
* Free lunch Fridays
* The ping-pong table

These are surface-level amenities that change with the budget.

### Culture is the Geology

* **Culture** is the bedrock of how decisions are made
* How conflict is resolved
* How mistakes are handled
* Who gets promoted and why
* What happens when someone speaks truth to power

When you buy a ping-pong table for a team that is overworked and underappreciated, you aren't boosting morale. You are insulting their intelligence. You are painting over mold.

### Why Perks Backfire

The Superhuman Framework argues that you cannot build a **Superhuman** company on a "Default" foundation. You need Pillars. A perk can be taken away when the budget gets tight. A Pillar holds the roof up when the storm comes.

**What employees actually want:**
* To be heard when they raise concerns
* Managers who don't micromanage
* Fair compensation for their expertise
* Work that doesn't destroy their personal life
* Leadership that admits mistakes

## The "Human First" Audit: Is Your Culture Extraction or Restoration?

Before you write another engagement survey, look at your organization through the lens of the **Unifying Theory**: *Business growth mirrors human growth.*

### The Three Critical Audits

Ask yourself these three hard questions:

**1. The Energy Audit**
When people leave a meeting with leadership, do they feel energized or drained?

**2. The Truth Audit**
Do people tell the truth in meetings, or do they wait until the meeting after the meeting (the parking lot conversation) to say what they really think?

**3. The Life Audit**
Does working here support the employee's holistic life, or does it compete with it?

### Extraction vs. Restoration Culture

> **If your culture is based on Extraction (getting the most out of people), you will always battle turnover. If it is based on Restoration (pouring into people), loyalty becomes the default.**

**Extraction Culture Looks Like:**
* Mandatory fun events during personal time
* "Family" language while demanding 60-hour weeks
* Recognition programs that feel performative
* Exit interviews where you finally listen

**Restoration Culture Looks Like:**
* Flexible hours that respect personal commitments
* Transparent career paths with real development
* Regular 1-on-1s where managers actually listen
* Problems fixed before they become exit interviews

## The 10H Pillars: A Blueprint for Retention

The 10H Pillars provide a vocabulary for culture that goes deeper than "Core Values" on a poster. Here is how to apply them to HR:

### The Foundation: Honest, Humble, Helpful

**Honest:**
Does your review process encourage real feedback, or does it force people to posture? Can employees tell the truth about workload without being labeled "not a team player"?

**Humble:**
Is your leadership team willing to admit when a policy failed? Or do they double down and blame "poor communication"?

**Helpful:**
Is your onboarding process actually helpful, or is it just paperwork? Do new hires feel supported or abandoned?

### The Well-Being: Healthy, Happy, Holistic Living

**Healthy:**
Are you creating an environment where burnout is prevented, or are you offering yoga classes to people working 70-hour weeks?

**Happy:**
Happiness isn't "fun." It's fulfillment. Are people growing? Do they see a future here?

**Holistic Living:**
This means acknowledging that your employee is also a parent, a partner, and a community member. If you demand 80 hours a week, you are attacking their "Whole Self." Eventually, the Human will fight back (usually by quitting).

### The Interaction: Humor, Humanity, Holiness

**Humor:**
Can people laugh at work without it being "forced fun"? Is there psychological safety for levity?

**Humanity:**
Do you treat people like ticket numbers or like humans with complex lives?

**Holiness:**
In a secular workplace, this means treating people with sacred respect. It means no gossiping. It means firing the "high performer" who destroys the team's spirit, because protecting the flock is more important than the quarterly results.

### The Drive: Hungry Hustle

This isn't about working harder. It's about caring deeply about the work. You can't mandate hustle, but you can create conditions where people *want* to give their best.

## Implementing "Honesty" and "Humility" in Policy

How do you turn these abstract words into HR policy?

### The "Humble" Job Description

Stop asking for "Rockstars" and "Ninjas." Be honest about the challenges of the role.

**Old Way:**
"We're looking for a rockstar developer who thrives in a fast-paced environment!"

**Superhuman Way:**
"This job is hard. You'll be working with legacy code while building new features. We don't have perfect documentation. Here's how we'll support you through that."

### The "Honest" Exit Interview

Most exit interviews are fake. People give sanitized answers because they don't want to burn bridges.

Create a culture where feedback is continuous so that by the time an exit interview happens, there are no surprises. Even better: fix the problems before people leave.

### The "Helpful" Performance Review

Performance reviews shouldn't be a surprise. If someone is underperforming, they should have heard about it weeks ago with specific support offered.

**Questions to ask:**
* What roadblocks are preventing your success?
* What do you need from me as your manager?
* Where do you want to grow?

## Redefining "Happy": It's Not About Fun, It's About Fulfillment

One of the 10H Pillars is **Happy**. But don't confuse this with "Fun."

### Fun vs. Happy

* **Fun** is a distraction (Happy Hour, pizza parties)
* **Happy** is a state of being (Fulfillment, growth, purpose)

Humans are happy when they are:
* Growing in their skills
* Feeling safe to be themselves
* Doing work that matters (Purpose)

You don't need to entertain your employees. You need to empower them.

### What Kills Happiness

* Unclear expectations
* Lack of growth opportunities
* Toxic team members protected by leadership
* Feeling invisible or interchangeable
* Work that feels meaningless

## The HR Leader as the Corporate Soul

This is a call to arms for every HR professional, People Ops leader, and Culture builder.

You are not an administrator. You are an architect.

### Your Real Job

You have the power to shift the conversation from "Resources" to "Humans." When you push back against a toxic policy, you are practicing **Love**. When you fight for a mental health day, you are practicing **Humanity**.

**The  Superhuman HR Leader:**
* Advocates for the human, even when it's unpopular
* Uses data to show the cost of extraction culture
* Builds systems that scale empathy
* Protects employees from leadership's worst impulses

> **Stop settling for buying things. Start building people.**

### Your Metrics Should Change

Stop measuring:
* Headcount
* Time to fill
* Cost per hire

Start measuring:
* Retention of high performers
* Internal mobility rate
* Manager effectiveness scores
* Cultural health indicators
* Employee referral rates

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. How do I convince my CEO to invest in "Culture" instead of just "Perks"?**

Speak their language. Show them the cost of turnover. Explain that "Perks" are a depreciating asset (people get bored of them), while "Pillars" like Trust and Safety are appreciating assets that increase speed and efficiency. Use the "Unifying Theory" to show that human bottlenecks are causing business bottlenecks.

**2. What are the 10H Pillars?**

They are the practical guardrails of the Superhuman Framework: Helpful, Honest, Humble, Healthy, Happy, Humor, Humanity, Holiness, Hungry Hustle, and Holistic Living.

**3. Isn't "Holiness" a religious term? Can I use it in a secular company?**

In the Superhuman Framework, "Holiness" refers to "set apart" behavior—integrity, moral courage, and treating others with sacred respect. You don't have to be a church to believe that people should be treated with dignity and that gossip is toxic.

**4. We don't have the budget for a culture overhaul. What can I do for free?**

The best cultural shifts are free. It costs $0 to be **Honest**. It costs $0 to be **Humble**. It costs $0 to start meetings with a "Human Check-in" instead of a status update. Culture is behavioral, not transactional.

**5. How do I measure the ROI of the Superhuman Framework?**

Look at *Retention Rates* (people staying), *eNPS* (Employee Net Promoter Score), and *Internal Promotion Rates*. Also, monitor the "Truth Audit"—are people willing to deliver bad news faster? That is a sign of high psychological safety.

**6. What if I am an HR department of one?**

Start small. Pick ONE Pillar (e.g., **Helpful**) and audit your current processes against it. Is your recruiting process helpful? Is your benefits enrollment helpful? Small human-centric tweaks build momentum.

**7. Can a toxic culture really be fixed?**

Yes, but it requires the **Persistence** Cornerstone. It won't happen overnight, and it usually requires leadership to admit they were wrong (Humility). If leadership refuses to change, you cannot fix the culture, you can only protect the people within your sphere of influence.
