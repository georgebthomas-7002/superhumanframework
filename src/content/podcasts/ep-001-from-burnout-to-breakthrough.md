## Episode Description

Welcome to the first episode of the Superhuman Framework Podcast!

In this raw and honest conversation, George B. Thomas shares his journey from a burned-out corporate marketer hiding behind a hoodie and hat to becoming a catalyst for transformation in leadership, marketing, and life.

You'll hear about:
- **The moment** he realized success on paper doesn't equal fulfillment
- **The pivot** that changed everything for him and his family
- **The framework** that emerged from his pain, experimentation, and breakthroughs
- **Why** he believes it's H2H (Human-to-Human), not B2B

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Success Without Fulfillment Is Just Suffering in Disguise

You can have the title, the salary, the recognition—and still feel empty. That's not failure. That's a wake-up call.

### 2. Your Breakdown Can Become Your Breakthrough

George's burnout wasn't the end of his story. It was the beginning. What feels like rock bottom is often the foundation for something extraordinary.

### 3. The Framework You Need Often Comes From the Pain You've Experienced

The Superhuman Framework didn't come from theory or textbooks. It came from real struggles, real failures, and real transformation.

### 4. It's Time to Stop Hiding

For years, George hid behind a hoodie and hat—literally and figuratively. What are you hiding behind? Your title? Your busyness? Your fear?
