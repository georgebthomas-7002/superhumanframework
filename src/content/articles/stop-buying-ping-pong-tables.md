# Stop Buying Ping Pong Tables: What Human Resources Leaders Really Need To Fix Culture

> **Featured Insight:** Perks cannot fix a culture problem that leadership behavior created. The real drivers of engagement are meaningful work, fair treatment, growth opportunities, and leaders who act with integrity. You do not need more toys. You need more truth, courage, and consistency.

---

If you work in human resources, you have probably heard some version of this suggestion from a leader.

"Maybe we just need some fun things in the office. A ping pong table. A kegerator. Something to boost morale."

It sounds harmless. It might even sound helpful.

The problem is simple.

**Perks cannot fix a culture problem that leadership behavior created.**

In this article, we will walk through why perks fall flat, what your people are really asking for, and a more human, practical way to shape culture that aligns with the Superhuman Framework.

You do not need more toys.
You need more truth, courage, and consistency.

## Do Perks Like Ping Pong Tables Actually Improve Culture?

Short answer: Not on their own.

Perks can add moments of joy. They can support a healthy culture that already exists. They cannot repair a culture where people do not feel safe, respected, or heard.

Recent research shows that human resources leaders name leader and manager development and organizational culture as their top priorities. Other surveys rank employee engagement and experience as the number one focus.

Nowhere in those lists do you see "buy more office games."

Why not?

Because the real drivers of engagement are things like meaningful work, fair treatment, growth opportunities, and leaders who act with integrity.

**Perks are noise if the signal of everyday behavior is broken.**

## What Human Resources Leaders Really See Behind The Perks

When a company installs new perks without addressing root issues, human resources professionals see what happens next.

- Employees show up to the new game room, but still whisper about pay inequity and favoritism.
- Teams enjoy the free snacks, but they are too exhausted to stay late and use them.
- Leaders point to perks as "proof" of how much they care, even while they avoid hard conversations or overwork their people.

Meanwhile, you sit in exit interviews and stay interviews and hear the truth.

- "I like the people, but I do not feel like leadership listens."
- "My manager has never really coached me, they just give orders."
- "We talk about values, but we do not live them when there is pressure."

You are not fighting a fun problem. **You are fighting a trust problem.**

And trust is built through consistent human behavior, not through entertainment.

## Culture Is Not A Perks Problem. Culture Is A Leadership Problem.

Culture is "how we do things around here" and "how it feels to be a human around here."

That lives in:

- Who gets promoted and why.
- How leaders react in moments of stress.
- What happens when someone speaks up about a problem.
- The tiny daily interactions that tell people, "You matter," or "You are replaceable."

Gartner's research points out that human resources leaders see leader and manager development as the top priority for a reason. Without better leadership, every new program sits on a shaky foundation.

The Superhuman Framework talks about building systems that are human first, rooted in purpose, passion, persistence, and love.

If leaders are not living those values, no amount of free food or game tables will make people feel safe and valued.

So the question becomes very practical.

**If you are in human resources, what can you focus on that actually changes culture?**

## The Human Centric Levers You Can Pull Instead Of Perks

Here are four levers that move culture more than any game table ever will.

### 1. Make purpose real, not rhetorical

Humans want to know why their work matters.

Help leaders connect day to day tasks to a deeper purpose. Not in a slogan on the wall, but in the way they talk about projects, goals, and tradeoffs.

You can:

- Coach leaders to start meetings with "why this matters to humans and customers."
- Add purpose questions into performance reviews and one to ones.
- Highlight stories where someone lived the values, not just hit a number.

When people feel the "why," work becomes more than another task list. It becomes part of a life they are proud of.

### 2. Train managers to lead humans, not just work

Most managers are promoted for individual performance, not people skills. That leaves them unprepared for conflict, coaching, and honest feedback.

You can:

- Build simple, practical training around three core skills: Listening, giving feedback, and setting clear expectations.
- Offer scripts and roleplays so managers practice, not just hear theory.
- Pair new managers with human resources partners for their first tough conversations.

When managers understand humans, not just metrics, everything lightens. Employees feel seen, and human resources is no longer the only emotional support hub.

### 3. Create real psychological safety

Psychological safety is not a buzzword. It is the lived experience of "I can speak up without fear of embarrassment or punishment."

You can:

- Run listening sessions where leaders mostly listen and do not defend.
- Give employees anonymous and named channels for feedback, and show visible follow through.
- Help leaders respond to feedback with "thank you" and "here is what we will try," instead of blame.

This is where love in the Superhuman Framework becomes visible. Not soft, sentimental love. Clear, respectful, action oriented care for the humans inside the company.

### 4. Design rituals that match your values

Perks are often one time purchases. Culture change is built through repeated rituals.

You can help leaders design rituals that embody your values, such as:

- Weekly "wins and lessons" circles where people share progress and learnings.
- Monthly "human spotlights" that honor behaviors aligned with purpose and values, not just output.
- Quarterly reset sessions where teams reflect on stress, workload, and what needs to change.

These rituals send a louder message than any game table ever will.

## How To Talk To Executives Who Want Quick Culture Wins

Here is where it gets tricky.

You might agree with everything so far, but your executives still want visible, quick signs that they are "doing something" for culture.

Here is a simple way to redirect that conversation without sounding like you are blocking fun.

1. **Acknowledge the intent.**
   "I love that you are thinking about ways to make work feel lighter and more connected."

2. **Name the real problem.**
   "The core issues we see in surveys and exit interviews are about trust, communication, and leadership, not a lack of games."

3. **Offer a better investment.**
   "If we took the budget for a game room and instead funded manager training, listening sessions, and one or two meaningful rituals, we would see more impact on engagement and retention."

4. **Show the business case.**
   Connect engagement and better leadership to outcomes like performance, innovation, and reduced turnover, backed by research.

You are not rejecting fun. You are protecting a deeper investment in humans.

## A Simple Culture Reset Plan Human Resources Can Lead

If you want a practical starting point, here is a straightforward plan you can adapt.

### Step 1: Clarify the human story

Gather your survey data, exit interview themes, and anecdotal stories. Turn them into a clear narrative.

- "Here is what people are telling us."
- "Here is how that connects to engagement, performance, and risk."
- "Here are three root issues under all of it."

Keep it simple, honest, and human.

### Step 2: Pick three high leverage moves

Instead of twelve scattered initiatives, choose three moves that align with the Superhuman Framework and your company context. For example:

- Manager training focused on real conversations.
- Listening and feedback system with visible response.
- A values based recognition ritual.

Tie each move to a clear outcome and a simple measure.

### Step 3: Enlist leaders as co owners, not spectators

Invite a small group of executives and influential managers into a working session.

Give them the story. Ask two questions.

- "Where do you feel this tension in your own teams?"
- "What are you personally willing to do in the next ninety days?"

Make it clear. Culture change is not a human resources project. It is an all leaders project that human resources guides.

### Step 4: Share the journey with your people

Tell your people what you heard and what you are doing about it.

- "Here is what you told us."
- "Here are the first three changes we are making."
- "Here is how you can keep giving feedback."

Follow through, even if the first steps are small. Humans do not expect perfection. They expect honesty, effort, and progress.

## What Should You Do Instead Of Buying More Perks?

If you remember only one thing from this article, let it be this.

**Do not let perk conversations distract you from the real work of culture.**

You are not the ping pong purchasing department.
You are the guide for how humans experience work in your company.

Your energy belongs in:

- Training and supporting leaders to act like humans, not just operators.
- Creating safe, honest spaces where people can speak and be heard.
- Designing rituals, systems, and stories that align with your purpose and values.
- Helping executives see that human centric culture is not a nice to have. It is a competitive edge.

When you focus there, your organization has a chance to truly flourish.

And if you still decide to buy a ping pong table, it will be the cherry on top of a culture that already feels worth belonging to.

## Context: How This Connects To The Superhuman Framework

The Superhuman Framework is all about building systems around humans first. It centers purpose, passion, persistence, and love as the core of healthy, high performing teams and companies.

This article positions human resources leaders as key stewards of that system. It moves the spotlight from surface level perks to deeper questions.

- Do our leaders live our values when it is hard?
- Do our humans feel safe enough to be honest?
- Do our structures support flourishing, or only output?

That is the real game.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. How do I convince my CEO to invest in culture instead of perks?**

Speak their language. Show them the cost of turnover in hard numbers. Explain that perks are a depreciating asset (people get bored), while trust and psychological safety are appreciating assets that increase speed, innovation, and retention. Use data to connect leadership development to business outcomes like performance and reduced risk.

**2. What if my executives still insist on buying perks?**

Do not fight the perks. Just make sure they come after, not instead of, the real work. Say "yes, and" instead of "no, but." Yes to the ping pong table, and let's also invest in manager training. Yes to free snacks, and let's also create listening sessions where people feel heard.

**3. Can culture really be fixed if leadership does not change?**

Honest answer: No. Culture flows from the top. If senior leaders model distrust, micromanagement, or burnout, no HR initiative can overcome that. Your job then becomes protecting the humans in your sphere of influence and creating pockets of health where you can, while being honest about what you can and cannot control.

**4. What is the fastest way to improve culture with limited budget?**

Start with psychological safety. It costs nothing to create regular listening sessions, respond to feedback with "thank you" instead of defensiveness, and train managers to have real conversations. The highest ROI culture moves are behavioral, not transactional.

**5. How do I measure if culture is actually improving?**

Track retention of high performers, internal mobility rates, manager effectiveness scores, and employee referral rates. Also watch for leading indicators like how fast bad news travels up, how often people speak up in meetings, and whether exit interview themes are changing over time.

**6. What if I am an HR team of one with no executive support?**

Start small and local. Pick one team or one manager who is open to trying something different. Run a pilot with listening circles or a new feedback ritual. Document what changes. Let the results speak for themselves. Sometimes culture change starts in the margins and moves to the center.

**7. Is it ever okay to buy perks?**

Absolutely. Perks are wonderful when they sit on top of a healthy culture, not as a substitute for one. If your people already feel safe, valued, and heard, then yes, add the ping pong table. It will actually be fun instead of insulting.
