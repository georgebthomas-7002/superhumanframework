## What You'll Get

The **Superhuman Leadership Assessment** is a comprehensive, science-backed tool designed to help you understand:

✅ **Where you are** as a leader right now (the good, the bad, and the ugly)

✅ **Where you're struggling** (purpose, trust, growth, or all of the above)

✅ **Your personalized roadmap** to becoming a transformational leader

✅ **Specific action steps** you can take this week to start improving

## Why This Assessment Is Different

Most leadership assessments give you a score and leave you hanging.

**This one doesn't.**

You'll get:

### 1. A Detailed Score Across the 5 Pillars
- **Purpose:** Are you leading with clarity or just checking boxes?
- **Trust:** Are you building or eroding trust with your team?
- **Helpful:** Are you serving or micromanaging?
- **Human:** Are you leading like a human or a robot?
- **Growth:** Are you evolving or stuck?

### 2. Your Leadership Archetype
Based on your results, you'll discover which of the **5 Leadership Archetypes** you currently embody:
- 🔥 **The Catalyst** - You inspire transformation
- 🛡️ **The Protector** - You build trust and safety
- 🎯 **The Strategist** - You see the big picture
- 💡 **The Innovator** - You challenge the status quo
- 🌱 **The Gardener** - You nurture growth

### 3. A Personalized Action Plan
You'll get **3 specific actions** to take in the next 7 days based on your results.

No fluff. No generic advice. Just practical, actionable steps.

## Who This Is For
