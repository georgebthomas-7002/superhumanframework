### Quiz Hero Full-Width Fix
**Commit:** `9fe0374`

#### Fixed Hero Section to Span Full Screen Width
Restructured QuizPage component to allow hero section to break out of constrained containers and match other pages:

**Problem Identified:**
- Hero section was constrained by parent `max-w-4xl` container
- Not spanning full screen width like LeadershipPage, SalesPage, MarketingPage
- Dark navy background didn't extend edge-to-edge
- Inconsistent visual experience across site

**Solution Implemented:**
- Moved Step 0 (intro/hero) outside of constrained wrapper
- Hero section now renders at component root level (full-width)
- Steps 1-7 remain in constrained layout with centered max-width
- Proper component structure with separate wrappers for different sections

**New Structure:**
```
QuizPage
├── Step 0: Full-width hero section
│   └── Content sections with max-w-5xl below hero
└── Steps 1-7: Constrained layout wrapper (min-h-[90vh])
    ├── Background blobs
    ├── Progress bar
    └── Content (max-w-4xl)
```

**Visual Result:**
- Hero section now spans full viewport width
- Dark navy (#142d63) background extends edge-to-edge
- ParticleBackground and breathing waves across full screen
- Blur circles positioned at viewport edges
- Perfect match with all other vertical page heroes
- Content sections below hero properly constrained for readability

**Technical Details:**
- Files modified: `src/App.jsx` (lines 888-1500)
- Restructured return statement with conditional wrappers
- Step 0: No constraints, full-width rendering
- Steps 1-7: Wrapped in centered layout with decorative blobs
- Build size: 658.08KB (no change)
- No functionality changes or regressions

        style={{
          backgroundColor: color,
          left: `${Math.random() * 100}%`,
          top: `${Math.random() * 100}%`,
        }}
        animate={{
          y: [0, -30, 0],
          opacity: [0.2, 0.5, 0.2],
        }}
        transition={{
          duration: 3 + Math.random() * 2,
          repeat: Infinity,
          delay: Math.random() * 2,
        }}
      />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

**Usage:**
- Home page hero: `<ParticleBackground color="#faaa68" />`
- Vertical page heroes: `<ParticleBackground color="#faaa68" />`
- NOT used in CTA sections (removed for cleaner design)

### SuperhumanLogo Component
```javascript
const SuperhumanLogo = ({ className = "h-10", godMode, whiteMode = false })
```

**Props:**
- `className`: Size and spacing
- `godMode`: Easter egg mode (activated by Konami code)
- `whiteMode`: All-white rendering for dark backgrounds (footer)

**Usage:**
- Navbar: `<SuperhumanLogo className="h-14" godMode={godMode} />`
- Footer: `<SuperhumanLogo className="h-12" whiteMode={true} />`

### Key Page Components
- All vertical pages (Leadership, Marketing, Sales, HR, Service, Pastors, Personal)
- WhoPage (main directory for all framework verticals)
- Home page with enhanced hero section

## Design System

### Colors
- Navy: `#142d63` (primary brand)
- Teal: `#028393` (accent)
- Orange: `#f65625` (CTA primary)
- Soft Orange: `#faaa68` (particles, accents)
- White: `#FFFFFF`
- Light Grey: `#F9FAFB` (card backgrounds)

### Animation Patterns
1. **Hero Sections:** ParticleBackground + breathing wave effect
2. **CTA Sections:** No background animation, white card design
3. **Buttons:** Scale + translateY on hover
4. **Icons:** Rotate 360° on view entry

## Next Steps / Potential Improvements
- Consider code splitting to reduce bundle size (currently 630KB)
- Add lazy loading for vertical page components
- Implement dynamic imports for routes
- Consider extracting ParticleBackground to shared components directory
